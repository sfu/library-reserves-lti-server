# This repository is archived

The code in the repository is no longer in production at Simon Fraser University and is condiered archived. The functionality provided has been replaced by seperate LTI repositories:

[Course Outlines](https://github.com/sfu/course-outlines-lti)
[Roster Photos](https://github.com/sfu/roster-photos-lti)

The Library Reserves LTI was replaced by a vendor solution managed by the SFU Library.

-------

# node-lti-server

An extensible, general-purpose web server for serving [LTI](https://lti-examples.heroku.com/code.html) apps for [SFU Canvas](http://www.sfu.ca/canvas).

## Current LTI Apps
* libraryReserves: displays the items on reserve at the [SFU Library](http://www.lib.sfu.ca) for a given Canvas course
* courseDescription: allows a user to embed the official [SFU Academic Calendar](http://www.sfu.ca/calendar) course description in a page by clicking a button in the rich text editor.

## Adding Apps
To add an app, simply create a new folder in `./components`. Put your app logic (routes, etc) in `./components/[YOUR_APP]/index.js`. You can create a `public` folder to hold your static assets; this will become automatically available at `http://SERVER/YOUR_APP/{javascripts,stylesheets,images,etc}/FILENAME`. Create a `views` folder for your views. In order to render views, you must explicitly tell `res.render()` where to find them: `res.render(path.join(__dirname, 'views/index'))`.

Look at `components/libraryReserves` or `components/courseDescription` for examples. There are probably better ways to do this, but it works.

## Deploying
To deploy to your localhost for development, `NODE_ENV=development node app`. For convenience, you may want to create a `configuration-dev.xml` file for your LTI app so you don't have to keep modifying your production one to point to your workstation. Note that `configuration-dev.xml` is in `.gitignore`.

To deploy to staging or production, use [Bamboo](https://bamboo.its.sfu.ca/bamboo/browse/NODELTI).
